SGD Mission Statement:
	To provide a coordinated and organized group for the personal study of and
	improvement in general game design.

Means to accomplish this task:
	Provide a coordinated organization with easy-to achieve meeting times on a 
	regular year-round schedule.

	Provide a set of increasingly complex product goals, with compounding
	relational usefulness (akin to mathematics), examining multiple design 
	genres, visual design spaces, and architectures, for use with personal
	resume, skill, and experience building.

	Provide a forum for beginners and experts alike to teach and learn new and
	interesting ideas.
	
	Provide a forum for internal and external investors to hire or aquire
	experienced game developers for the creation of new entertainment or 
	productivity software.
	
	Provide an openly readable software repository for members to display past
	work to future interests.
